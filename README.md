This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.

Setting Up the Environment to Run Angular Code
These instructions will guide you through the process of setting up your development environment to run the Angular code from your GitHub repository.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

Node.js and npm: Angular requires Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager), to manage packages and dependencies.

Download and install Node.js and npm from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
Clone the Repository
Clone the Repository: Start by cloning your Angular project repository from GitHub to your local machine. You can use either the command line or a Git GUI client. Replace your-repo-url with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

sh
Copy code
git clone your-repo-url
Navigate to the Project Directory: Change into the project directory using the command:

sh
Copy code
cd your-repo-directory
Install Dependencies
Install Angular CLI: If you don't have Angular CLI installed globally, you can install it using npm:

sh
Copy code
npm install -g @angular/cli
Install Project Dependencies: Inside your project directory, install the project-specific dependencies using npm:

sh
Copy code
npm install
Run the Application
Start the Development Server: To run your Angular application locally, use the following command:

sh
Copy code
ng serve
This will start the development server. By default, your application will be accessible at http://localhost:4200/.

Access the Application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/ to view and interact with your Angular application.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
